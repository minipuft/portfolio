# The Era of Living Interfaces

In the year 3000, interfaces don't just respond to clicks—they anticipate intent. They breathe. They are **alive**.

## Ambient Awareness

The cursor is not a pointer; it's a presence. Our interfaces should ripple and warp as this presence moves through the digital fabric.

  This portfolio implements this using a magnetic cursor field and WebGL distortion layers.

## Resonant Feedback

When you interact with a system, it should echo back. Not with a static state change, but with a physics-based ripple that propagates through the grid.

### Key Principles

1.  **Breathing**: Idle states are never static.
2.  **Anticipation**: UI elements prepare for interaction before contact.
3.  **Resonance**: Actions have consequences that ripple outward.

```typescript
// Example of a breathing hook
const breathing = useColorBreathing({
  baseColor: '#7aa2f7',
  hueRange: 10
});
```
